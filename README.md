# Urbanero

Urbanero is a platform for participatory urban development and collective decision-making.

The project has come about as part of the research for master thesis looking at design best practices for citizen participation smartphone apps. Compared to commercial platforms, existing participatory governance solutions lack in regards to ease-of-use, adoption and overall user experience. More often than not, they are just glorified contact forms which citizens can use to send one-directional messages into a void of their local bureaucracy.

Urbanero is built on principles that aim to provide a citizen-centric platform where local governments can have genuine dialogue with their constituents leveraging increasingly ubiquitous access to smartphones.
