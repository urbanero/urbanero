# Urbanero

Urbanero is a platform for participatory urban development and collective decision-making.

The project has come about as part of the research for master thesis looking at design best practices for citizen participation smartphone apps. Compared to commercial platforms, existing participatory governance solutions lack in regards to ease-of-use, adoption and overall user experience. More often than not, they are just a glorified contact form which citizens can use to send a one-directional message into a void of their local bureaucracy.

Urbanero has at its core principles that aim to provide a genuinely participatory citizen-centric platform where local governments can have a two-way dialogue with their constituents using increasingly ubiquitous access to smartphones.
